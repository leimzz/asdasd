            <h2>Shanks OP01-120 Parallel Alternate Art Manga ($793)</h2>
            <!-- Text Description for Shanks Card -->
            <p class="card-text"> The most valuable card for the One Piece card game in 2023 is Shanks. This version of Shanks is the Parallel Alternate Art Manga of him.
                This is from the Romance Dawn set and the manga panels in the background ensure that this card is different from any other card in the entire set.
                Close to $800 at $793 as the median price, Manga Shanks is the only Manga card of the Romance Dawn set. His play cost may be high requiring 9 Don!! cards, but due to Shanks being a Red Character card with 10,000 Power, you can attack with him the turn he is played due to Rush.                                                                                                                   
            </p>

            <h2>Ace OP02-013 Parallel Alternate Art Manga ($707)</h2>
            <!-- Text Description for Ace Card -->
            <p class="card-text">Portgas.D.Ace Parallel Alternate Art Manga of him is the second most valuable card. This like the Manga Shanks card is the only one of its set to have a manga version at $707.
                This Manga Ace is of the Paramount War set. The manga panels in the background portray one of the most devastating and heartbreaking scenes of the source material.
                A character card that can weaken two of your opponent’s characters by 3000 Power for one turn, and having a leader with Whitebeard Pirates grant Ace Rush to attack in the same turn he is played.
                Any fan of this character would love to have this card in their possession with its art solidifying one of the impactful moments in One Piece.

            <h2>Sogeking OP01-122 Parallel Alternate Art Manga ($300)</h2>
            <!-- Text Description for Sogeking Card -->
            <p class="card-text"> Sogeking Parallel Alternate Art Manga is the third most valuable card in 2023. It does have a large gap in value in comparison to Manga Ace, but Sogeking is the sole Manga card of the Pillars of Strength set at $300.
                The manga panels in the background showcase Usopp’s transformation, character growth, and resolve into Sogeking alongside his appearance as the King of Snipers.
                If you are a fan of Usopp, then this card with its manga background panels is an easy want; especially due to it being the lowest of the three manga cards currently.
